# How long-distance running helped me cope with being laid off.

I worked at Meta for a long time and was laid off in Nov. I spent the next three months looking for a job. I found it hard and felt unprepared. 

It could have been worse. The severance package was generous, I didn't have to worry about visa issues, and there was overwhelming encouragement from friends, family, and ex-colleagues. 

But more than any of these, it was long-distance running that did the most to help me get through this period. 

To be clear, I'm not an elite runner. I do the type of long-distance running that almost anyone can do with some training. I've always enjoyed running but I only started running longer distances a few months before the layoff -- a friend was into it and made it seem exciting.

I wanted to share some of the lessons it taught me. It's possible that others can benefit just by reading them, but for me it was only after experiencing them directly through regular long-distance running that I really understood and appreciated them. I would recommend this path.

## 1/ Embrace pain every day.

As a human being I recognise that there are strong internal forces that are trying to keep me in my comfort zone, safe from physical and psychological harm. But this comes at the huge cost of personal growth. By staying in my comfort zone I wasn't making much progress towards my goals. 

Interviewing exposed me to pain. I had to make myself vulnerable in front of another person whose judgement would have a big impact on my future career. It was hard not to take rejection personally. I found I was inventing reasons to avoid this pain: "this job isn't a good fit for me", "I'm not prepared yet", "I've done enough interviewing this week".

I saw the same behaviour towards my running: "I'm too tired today", "it's raining", "my bed is so comfortable this morning".

But through forcing myself to get up early and go for a long run every day I started to notice that: a) the pain was never as bad as I worried it might be, b) my tolerance for pain increased over time, c) the more pain I endured the stronger I felt afterwards. 

This last point was the most eye-opening for me. There was something about willingly accepting a challenge that I knew was going to be painful, pushing through it and coming out the other side, that was incredibly energising.

I applied this to interviewing. I forced myself to schedule at least one interview every day. After a few weeks I noticed my anxiety levels during interviews coming down. The sting of rejection didn't hurt as much; you learn something about yourself, you move on. And I started looking forward to the hard interviews, as a chance to test how well I could express myself in areas where I was strong and discover new areas where I was weak. Coming out of one of these hard interviews, knowing that I'd survived, was a thrill.

This lesson forced me to think about pain in a new way. Instead of seeing it as something to avoid, I started seeking it out as an opportunity -- to endure temporary discomfort with the promise that afterwards you'll be in a better place. This was a tradeoff I found myself more and more willing to make.

## 2/ Trust your training.

To run longer and longer distances you need a training plan. The plan covers weekly mileage, nutrition, gear, etc. The plan helps you slowly develop confidence and stamina, run after run.

No matter how many runs I'd already completed I always found myself getting nervous before a particularly long run. As I was putting my gear on I would feel doubts creep in: "you've never run this far before, I don't think you can do it", "you pushed yourself too far this week and your legs are gone", "it's too hot and you're not carrying enough water".

I saw the exact same thing happen before each interview. No matter how many questions I'd prepared answers to, or how much time I'd spent studying computer science and management theory, I'd always experience growing doubts as I got closer to an interview.

Initially I tried wrestling with these doubts. Trying to identify each specific doubt and then building a case for why it wasn't true. This was exhausting and I found myself beginning interviews stressed and distracted. 

Before a long run I learnt that I could dispel these doubts by reminding myself of the "easy out" inherent in running -- I could always just stop. This safety net gave me the confidence before each run to try putting faith in my ability to prepare appropriately, and simply ignore the doubts. Worst case is I stop running, nothing bad is likely to happen.

After a few weeks of no runs having to be aborted, the confidence I had in my ability to prepare for a "performance event" grew. I came to expect these pre-performance doubts as routine, and had less difficulty in dismissing them. It wasn't too difficult to carry this same mindset over to interviewing, where I found myself going into interviews with more confidence and focus.

## 3/ Anticipate despair.

Looking for a new job has plenty of highs and lows. My early stage interviews are going well, I begin to let myself get excited at the possibility of working at this new company, but then a senior interviewer in a late stage interview asks me questions about a situation I haven't prepared for and have no prior experience with. It's over. Weeks of preparation and adrenaline and I'm back to where I started.

With a family to support financially and savings that are dwindling by the week, these setbacks are heavy to bear.

And perhaps hardest of all, I'm working through this alone. 

During those three months there were definitely times when I was tired and close to giving up hope. 

These dark moments felt very similar to dark moments that I often experienced on long runs. The initial excitement of the run has gone, I still have a long way to go, my legs hurt, and I'm starting to feel like I have no energy left. 

What typically follows is that negative thoughts enter my mind that try to convince me to stop: "you're not cut out for these long distances", "you were too ambitious this time, stop and try again another time", "that pain in your ankle is going to turn into a serious injury". I then lose perspective and my world shrinks to encompass only my aching, weary body. At this point I would typically give up and stop.

But I did some reading and discovered that this experience is pretty common in long-distance running, and that you can anticipate it and develop an ability to overcome it. 

I won't go into the full details of the technique -- bringing your focus back to the present moment and the next step you need to take, recognising that pain is often illusory and temporary, reminding yourself of your original motivation for wanting to achieve the goal, etc. The point is that this technique can be learnt and strengthened through repeated use. And that once you've developed a certain proficiency you can use it to spark your willpower in most situations when you're exhausted and demoralised. 

## 4/ Start each day with an act of discipline.

Back before I started running every morning my day would start like this: my alarm would go off, I'd sleep in a little, I'd sit up in bed and aimlessly read content on my phone, I'd slowly get up and move towards the kitchen for breakfast. This morning routine established a mental softness and fogginess that stayed with me for the rest of the day. I felt weaker in the face of the subsequent challenges that the day would bring: "healthy breakfast? nope, I'll take the leftover pizza from last night", "take the stairs up out of the subway? I'll wait for the elevator", "fill out that job application? I'll do it tomorrow".

Developing a habit of forcing myself out of bed every morning to run -- before my mind had a chance to wake up and protest -- took time and effort (see 1/ Embrace pain every day.). But, the result was that this single act of discipline set the tone for the rest of my day. I felt the run had blown away my mental fogginess, the endorphins had induced a sense of calm in me, and I had completed the first turn of the "challenge/success" flywheel that would then continue spinning and building momentum as the day went on. I felt more empowered to take on the next challenge of the day, be it another interview, reflecting on a rejection, or just motivating myself to keep going.

## Final thoughts.

Many of life's challenges can be framed as endurance challenges. For me this was about enduring a lengthy period of unemployment in search of a new job. For someone else it could be raising children, dealing with an illness, or starting a business. 

What I learnt through the simple act of putting on some running shoes each day and heading out was a set of tools that made me better able to handle this challenge.

I've been long-distance running for less than six months and already feel it's taught me so much. It's also a great antidote to our overly comfortable and sedentary lives. Like good food it's hard to share the experience through words, you really need to go out and try it.
